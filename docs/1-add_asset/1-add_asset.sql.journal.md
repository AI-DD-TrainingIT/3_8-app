# SQL Implementation Journal for Add Asset Feature

## Overview

This journal documents the implementation of the SQL structure for the "Add Asset" feature. The implementation adds database tables, entity types, and initialization code for the assets management functionality.

## Key Actions and Decisions

1. **Created categories.sql.json**
   - Defined SQL commands for the categories table
   - Added seed data for predefined asset categories
   - Included constraints to ensure name uniqueness

2. **Created assets.sql.json**
   - Defined SQL commands for the assets table
   - Added foreign key constraints to reference categories and users tables
   - Used appropriate data types (DECIMAL for value, INTEGER for quantity)

3. **Created category.type.ts**
   - Defined the Category domain entity with proper typing
   - Implemented validation for risk and liquidity levels
   - Added NULL_CATEGORY as a default empty value

4. **Created asset.type.ts**
   - Defined the Asset domain entity with proper typing
   - Implemented validation with business rules:
     - Value and quantity must be positive
     - Category and user associations are required
     - Acquisition date must be in proper format

5. **Updated initialize.utils.ts**
   - Added initialization functions for categories and assets tables
   - Implemented seed function for categories using predefined data
   - Created proper typing for the seed data to avoid type errors

## Implementation Notes

- Categories have three risk levels: Low, Medium, High
- Categories have three liquidity levels: Low, Medium, High
- Assets must be associated with both a category and a user
- Acquisition date is stored as a DATE in the database
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

## Next Steps

The SQL implementation is now complete. The next steps would be:

1. Create API endpoints for managing assets
2. Implement the client-side UI for asset management
3. Add functionality to view assets by category or other filters
