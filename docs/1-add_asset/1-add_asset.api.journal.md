# API Implementation Journal for Add Asset Feature

## Overview

This journal documents the implementation of the API layer for the "Add Asset" feature. The implementation adds API endpoints, controllers, repositories, and DTOs for managing assets and categories.

## Key Actions and Decisions

1. **Created API Resource Structure**
   - Set up folders for assets and categories API resources
   - Followed the server API structure pattern from existing resources

2. **Implemented Asset Repository**
   - Created functions to interact with the assets database table
   - Added support for retrieving assets by user ID
   - Implemented asset creation with validation

3. **Implemented Categories Repository**
   - Created functions to retrieve all categories
   - Added support for retrieving a category by ID

4. **Created Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**
   - Defined `CreateAssetRequest` for asset creation input
   - Defined `AssetResponse` for standardized asset output
   - Defined `CategoryResponse` for category data
   - Ensured proper typing for all DTOs

5. **Implemented Asset Controller**
   - Added GET endpoint to retrieve user's assets
   - Added POST endpoint to create new assets
   - Implemented mapping from domain entities to response DTOs
   - Added category name to asset responses for better UX

6. **Implemented Categories Controller**
   - Added GET endpoint to retrieve all categories
   - Implemented mapping from domain entities to response DTOs

7. **Updated API Configuration**
   - Registered new routes in the main API controller
   - Ensured proper routing for all endpoints

## Implementation Notes

- Assets are always associated with the authenticated user
- Category information is included in asset responses
- All endpoints require authentication
- Validation is performed at the repository level
- Timestamps are handled automatically by the repository layer

## Next Steps

The API implementation is now complete. The next steps would be:

1. Create the client-side UI for asset management
2. Implement form validation for asset creation
3. Add asset listing and filtering functionality

## Commit Prompt
