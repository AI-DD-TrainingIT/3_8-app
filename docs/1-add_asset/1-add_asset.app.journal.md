# Feature 1 - Add Asset: App Tier Implementation Journal

## Implementation Summary

The App tier for Feature 1 (Add Asset) has been successfully implemented. This feature allows authenticated investors to add new assets to their portfolio by specifying category, value, quantity, and acquisition date.

### Key Components Implemented

1. **Domain Entities**:
   - `Asset`: Represents an investment asset with properties like category_id, value, quantity, and acquisition_date
   - `Category`: Represents a classification for assets

2. **Repositories**:
   - `asset.repository.ts`: Handles API communication for asset-related operations (CRUD)
   - `category.repository.ts`: Handles API communication for category-related operations (read-only)

3. **Web Components**:
   - `asset-form.component.ts`: Form component for creating new assets
   - `asset-list.component.ts`: List component for displaying user assets
   - `category-select.component.ts`: Reusable component for category selection

4. **Pages**:
   - `assets.page.ts`: Page component for displaying the asset list
   - `assets-add.page.ts`: Page component for displaying the asset form

5. **Navigation**:
   - Updated header component to include links to asset management pages
   - Updated navigation utilities to register the new page components

## Implementation Decisions

1. **Repository Pattern**: Implemented repositories in a dedicated `/src/client/repositories` folder to separate data access concerns from UI components.

2. **Component Structure**: Created components following the Web Component standard, extending HTMLElement and using lifecycle methods (connectedCallback, disconnectedCallback).

3. **Form Validation**: Added client-side validation in both the asset entity type and the form component to ensure data integrity before submission.

4. **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling in repositories and components to provide feedback to users.

5. **Navigation**: Used the existing navigation system to integrate the new pages, ensuring a consistent user experience.

## Future Improvements

1. **Asset Editing**: The current implementation supports viewing and adding assets. A future enhancement could include editing existing assets.

2. **Category Management**: Currently, categories are read-only. A future feature could allow managing categories.

3. **Filtering and Sorting**: The asset list could be enhanced with filtering and sorting capabilities.

4. **Pagination**: For users with many assets, pagination could be added to the asset list.
